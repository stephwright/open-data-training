# Open Data Training For Neuroscience
### Why is this here?
The aims of this part of the repo are two-fold:
- Firstly to help me plan / get feedback on an Open-Science workshop for our department's training day which is happening in January '17 
- Secondly to provide a specific use-case of how the materials in this repo can be applied

### Planning
- [ ] Describe the audience
- [ ] What do we want them to come away with?
- [ ] Is there a good way of getting both immediate and medium-term (6 months?) feedback on the impact of the training

### ToDo
- [ ] Get lecture slides from Data Sharing meeting at FENS
- [ ] Get in touch with Stephen Eglen
- [ ] Get more familiar with tools such as binder and figshare, which is best solution for reserchers at our unit
