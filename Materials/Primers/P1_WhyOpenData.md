# Why Open Data: A Primer
## Hello.

<*insert interactive here: What three words would you use to describe open data?*>

You’re probably here because you’ve heard a lot about open data recently and you want to know more. This primer is a very quick introduction to the topic. We’ll be talking about the kind of data collected or observed by researchers, governments, and other groups to study problems or questions in fields as diverse as astrophysics, urban planning, and linguistics. This primer was produced by Mozilla Science Lab, a program dedicated encouraging the use of open source practices and web technologies to do better science. 

## Let's talk open data.
By data we mean numbers, but also geospatial coordinates, text, images, multimedia items, and other types of information that can be used to answer questions or solve problems. We may think of data as being collected by researchers and scientists-- for example, information on the spread of a population of ladybugs in a particular region, or the wavelengths of light emitted by a particular star. But data is also collected by governments, who may be interested in the number and location of potholes on a city street, or the geospatial pattern of new cases in an outbreak of the flu. Corporations and businesses collect data, too. 

**All of this data is potentially useful and powerful. “Opening” data means maximizing that potential.**

So what is open data? Here’s a working definition: **Open data is data that is made freely and easily available to anyone to use, re-use and distribute**. 

The Open Knowledge Foundation, an organization dedicated to bringing “openness” to the mainstream, defines the following key factors that make data “open”:
* **Access & availability** - data is available to all in a convenient and modifiable form
* **Re-use & redistribution** - terms of use allow for reusing, remixing and redistributing the data
* **Universal participation** - there are no restrictions on who may do any of the above with the data

But why bother taking your carefully collected, hard-earned data, and setting it free on the internet, for strangers to reuse, remix, and redistribute? There are lots of reasons-- we explore just a few of those next. 

## Why open data?
Open data helps to: 

**1. Maintain Accountability**  
*When data is open, the results or findings of that data can be more easily verified, increasing public trust in research institutions and governments.*  

**2. Speed Discovery**  
*When data is open, researchers working in parallel on similar problems don’t need to duplicate work and can use each others’ data to advance knowledge across their research area.*

**3. Encourage collaboration across disciplines**  
*When data is open, researchers can more easily find those outside their subject area doing related or relevant work; these connections and collaborations may lead to new ways of approaching and solving problems.*
 
**4. Solve a broader range of problems**  
*When data is open, new users-- from academic researchers to citizen scientists to artists- may use it to answer questions, solve problems, or create public understanding in ways that the original data collector may never have imagined.*

**5. Encourage public engagement with research**  
*When data is open and the findings are shared in a clear and accessible way, it increases public understanding, creates opportunities for public participation, and bolsters public support of research initiatives.*
 
**6.  Ensure that data is preserved**  
*When data is open and widely shared, the responsibility for the long-term archiving and preservation of that data is distributed across broader group of interested users.*

## Open data IRL
Open data sounds great on paper. But what does deciding to share-- or deciding not to share-- your data look like in real life? Here’s a recent example of open data in action.

When an outbreak of the previously rare Zika Virus Disease emerged in South America in early 2015, it was clear that the threat to public health was--and remains--urgent. Researchers in David O’Connor’s lab at the University of Wisconsin, Madison decided that the epidemic, which may lead to devastating birth defects in babies born to infected women, called for a new level of collaboration. He decided to release real-time, day by day results of his studies on the effects of Zika on Macaque monkeys, rather that waiting months (or years) for the results of his work to be published in a traditional journal. By releasing both his data and findings online, O’Connor invited international collaboration. Researchers from around the world downloaded and reviewed the data, made comments, provided advice, and even offered to lend expertise and equipment to run tests that O’Connor’s lab wasn’t equipped to perform. Studies are still underway, but it’s likely that opening this data-- and creating connections among researchers globally--  will aid efforts to understand and combat Zika. See what data sharing looks like in real life by visiting O’Connor’s [Zika Open-Research Portal] (https://zika.labkey.com/project/home/begin.view).  To read more, see the story covered in [Nature] (http://www.nature.com/news/zika-researchers-release-real-time-data-on-viral-infection-study-in-monkeys-1.19438), [The Economist] (http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21694990-old-fashioned-ways-reporting-new-discoveries-are-holding-back-medical-research), and on [National Public Radio] (http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/08/469653715/scientists-report-in-real-time-on-challenging-zika-research) in the USA. 

The Zika story shows how open data might help speed scientific discovery and improve research practice. See below for more stories that support each of our six reasons to open your data. 

**Maintain Accountability.** Expand to learn how open data helped researchers evaluate critical findings on global economic policy.

<*expanded content*>  
In 2010, two economics professors from Harvard published a paper on economic policy that was widely publicized and very influential during a time of global economic instability. In 2013, University of Massachusetts researchers were unable to replicate the results of this study; they requested the data set from the original authors and discovered coding errors, data omissions, and unconventional methods of analysis that call into question the validity of the original conclusion. [Read more about this case here] (http://blog.okfn.org/2013/04/22/reinhart-rogoff-revisited-why-we-need-open-data-in-economics/).  

**Speed Discovery.** Expand to learn how a revolutionary open research project generated a wealth of genomics knowledge.

<*expanded content*>  
In the early 2000s, two competing research projects, the Human Genome Project (HGP) and efforts by biotech company Celera, worked to sequence the human genome. HGP put all of its data in the public domain, while Celera tried to patent its findings.  A 2013 study by an MIT economist shows HGP’s open data generated more knowledge and innovation (as measured by publications and the development of diagnostic tests) than Celera’s patented sequences. [Learn more about the study here] (https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130403/09501122561/public-domain-human-genome-project-generated-more-research-more-commercial-activity-than-proprietary-competitor.shtml).

**Encourage collaboration across disciplines.** Expand to learn how researchers, from soil scientists to meteorologists are creating a data sharing network to better understand and prepare for climate change.

<*expanded content*>  
The Midwestern U.S. is known as the “country’s breadbasket”-- a major food producing region for that nation. Climate change is expected to affect production in coming decades, possibly dramatically. Agricultural scientists, meteorologists, and climate modelers all gather or generate data separately that, when pieced together, may provide a comprehensive understanding of these effects, but data and findings are rarely shared across disciplines. In a [2015 article] (http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/12/10/biosci.biv164.full.pdf+html), a group of scientists from disparate disciplines laid out a plan to share and use data across a network of research sites, in order to create better climate models and apply data from models to the design of mitigation and adaptation strategies. [Learn more about the network here] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-bread-basket-shifts-thanks-to-climate-change/). 

**Solve a broader range of problems.** Click to learn how an Australian initiative to link divergent data sets is creating opportunities to make discoveries and solve problems on a continental scale. 

<*expanded content*>  
Australia’s Oznome Project aims to amass all available data on that nation’s economy, infrastructure, agriculture, public health, energy and water systems, and more into one centralized, accessible database. The name “Oznome” is a hat-tip to the Human Genome project, the effort to gather data on every single gene in the human genome. By 2025, Oznome aspires to be just as comprehensive, creating a “historical, current and future digital representation of everything” in Australia.  Linking diverse data sets will allow researchers to explore the relationships between systems to anticipate and solve problems that may not have been apparent in a single data set. And tackling problems of compatibility across diverse data sets, while daunting, may lead to better, richer predictive models as well as lower costs associated with data discovery, access and preparation. [Learn more about the Oznome project] (https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076539-australias-plan-to-make-a-digital-representation-of-everything/).

**Encourage public engagement with research.** Click to learn how a schoolteacher helped discover a new kind of celestial object.

<*expanded content*>  
In 2007, a Dutch schoolteacher was browsing through images from the Hubble space telescope, made freely available online via the platform Galaxy Zoo. The teacher spotted a glowing green cloud floating next to a distant galaxy, and alerted researchers to her discovery. Galaxy Zoo is a project of Zooniverse, a platform for participatory research that invites the public to study objects or artifacts collected in research, and answer simple questions about them. The platform enables analysis of large data sets by crowdsourcing this work to human volunteers, who provide results that are superior to pattern recognition algorithms. On the Zooniverse platform, volunteers and researchers engage, discuss results, and even make significant discoveries together. That Dutch schoolteacher’s glowing cloud turned out to be a new kind of celestial object, produced by dust from ancient galactic collisions interacting with black holes. Working together, researchers and citizen scientists have since found 19 more of these objects, known as Hanny’s Voorwerpjes (“Hanny’s Objects,” in Dutch). Read more about [Hanny’s Voorwerp] (http://www.wired.com/2015/04/citizen-scientists-find-green-blobs-hubble-galaxy-shots/), and browse a list of [publications from all Zooniverse projects] (https://www.zooniverse.org/about/publications). 

**Ensure that data is preserved.** Learn how historical images of the first moon landing were lost, and then reconstructed from copies archived elsewhere. 

<*expanded content*>  
In 1969, when the United State’s Apollo 11 mission brought the first humans to the moon, the astronauts recorded their historic spacewalk using a special lunar camera and unique film format. Images were beamed back to earth, converted to a broadcast-friendly format, and shown live on TV screens around the globe. The now-familiar footage of those first steps is actually a significantly degraded version of the original, due to conversion from the lunar camera’s special format. Almost 40 years later, engineers decided to apply 21st century imaging technology to the original footage, to see if a crisper, higher resolution dub was possible. NASA tried to locate the master magnetic tapes but they’d gone missing. Following an epic search through the organization’s massive archives, officials concluded that the original moon landing footage was recorded over with satellite footage captured sometime in the 1980s, during a period when the agency was short on magnetic tape. Fortunately, media agencies worldwide archived the 1969 broadcast so the historical record, albeit low-resolution, endures. Engineers were able make an [HD restoration of the footage] (https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/hd/apollo11_hdpage.html) by compiling all available archived versions. This cautionary tale highlights how sharing critical data widely ensures its preservation-- [read more here] (http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106637066).

##Open data *sounds* great, but ... 
You’ve probably heard some counter-arguments to open data and you may have a few lingering questions yourself. Here are three of the most frequently voiced challenges to open data, and our answers to them.  

**“I’ll be scooped! Someone could discover something amazing in my data before I have a chance publish.”**  
Of course, you want to get as much as you can out of the data you collect and maintain. However, when you make data publicly available, you’re letting everyone know that you did it first.  Open data is the ultimate security: no one can steal what has been freely shared.

**“Documenting my data so someone else can understand it is too complicated. Who has time?”**  
Actually, documenting your data isn’t just good for science and collective human knowledge. Any time spent adding context and meta-information to your data now will save you hours and hours of trying to decipher your research a year or two or ten years down the road.  Spend a half an hour writing up a [Data Reuse Plan] (http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/data_reuse/). Other researchers-- and your future self-- will thank you for it!

**“It’s so confusing! I don’t know where to start.”**
We’re here to help! And you don’t have to do all at once. There are lots of simple ways to get started, and we’ve outlined them in the second primer in this series, How to Open Your Data. Take a look and see if there are one or two best practices you can incorporate into your workflow now. 

For 6 more challenges to open data and snappy and convincing responses to each of them, [click here] (https://github.com/mozillascience/open-data-training/blob/master/Materials/Handouts/ODChallengesQI.md). These are great talking points to use when telling your colleagues, friends, and loved ones about open data.  There are valid concerns about privacy and ethics when it comes to open data.  We will be diving into those topics in future primers.

## Why does Mozilla <3 open data?

The idea of open data is nothing new, but has gained popularity with the rise of the World Wide Web. The easily accessible, information-rich web is home to countless online communities where people from around the world freely and asynchronously share and discuss content and ideas. This technology has already transformed nearly every sphere of our lives… and it has the potential to do much more. 

This Open Data Primer was produced by Mozilla, the organization that makes the Firefox web browser. Why Mozilla? Well, Firefox is open source, meaning the project’s code is freely available online for anyone to use and reuse, and the project invites participation and collaboration from all.  At Mozilla, we recognize that the web is an awesome tool for creation and collaboration, a space where people can find each other, communicate, and work together. **We’re convinced we can use the web, emerging technologies, and open practices to do better science.** To learn more, check out Mozilla’s Science Lab program <*link to main MSL site*>. We offer trainings <*insert link to our training pages*> and support communities of people working with and for open data <*insert link to Community page*>.
