# WELCOME to the Open Data Training Program Repository!

## Special huge WELCOME and thank you to those of you joining us through the 2016 Global Sprint! :star2: :tada:

The Mozilla Science Lab is developing an Open Data Training Program.  This repository will be where we build and share our curriculum and resources for open data.

Here's what's been developed so far.

* [Primers] (/Materials/Primers/)
* [Exercises] (/Materials/Exercises/)
* [Handouts] (/Materials/Handouts/)

Our first priority is to create Modules based off the Primers linked above so we can expand the network of trainers of open data best practices.

## For the Global Sprint:
We will be working mostly in these Google Docs, just because editing and commenting on a doc is easier that way.  These aren't formal... please feel free to be creative.  They will be refined and "made pretty" in their final format.  If you don't feel comfortable editing directly, feel free to use the "Suggesting" editing mode in the upper right corner of the Google docs.
* Primer 1: [Why Open Data] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_brrnB0unF1vbwaDrxkzndZcj9kmDmyaC6MOTFL6PFM/edit?usp=sharing)
* Primer 2: [How to Open Your Data] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_2QKOJ0VUbdYqsBSMkszw_f3y1uI8vPsfiMt405cjU/edit?usp=sharing) 
* Primer 3: [Sharing Your Data] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--iN0Ycqvy8ymWnUzwd8h5ZEVtQccSzUoZQjc6AY__s/edit?usp=sharing)  
**Note:** Primer 3 is still in VERY rough draft form and not complete.  Suggestions welcome!

All Modules are in VERY rough form.  Feel free to comment / suggest / hack.
