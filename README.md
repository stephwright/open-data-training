# WELCOME to the Open Data Training Program Repository!

The Mozilla Science Lab is developing an Open Data Training Program.  This repository will be where we build and share our curriculum and resources for open data.

Here's what's been developed so far.

* [Primers](https://mozillascience.github.io/open-data-primers/index.html)
* [Instructor Guides](https://mozillascience.github.io/open-data-guides/)

Our first priority is to complete the first five primers as laidout in the Roadmap linked below. Following that, we will be writing up Instructor Guides based off those primers.  You can see an example at the link to Instructor Guides above.

If you'd like to see our current plan for development of this program, check out our [Roadmap] (/planning/ROADMAP.md). 

If you are looking for more information on Mozilla Science Lab, please see our [website](https://www.mozillascience.org/).
